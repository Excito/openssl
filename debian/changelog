  * Don't call gcc with -mcpu on i386, we already use -march, so no need for
    -mtune either.
  * Always make all directories when building something:
    - The engines directory didn't get build for the static directory, so
      where missing in libcrypo.a
    - The apps directory didn't always get build, so we didn't have an openssl
      and a small part of the regression tests failed.
  * Make the package fail to build if the regression tests fail.

    from 1/3/5/7 to 1SSL/3SSL/5SSL/7SSL.  The name of the files

    to other manpage is still wrong.
  * Don't install the LICENSE file, it's already in the copyright file.
  * Don't set an rpath on openssl to point to /usr/lib.
  * Add support for kfreebsd-amd64. (Closes: #355277)

openssl (0.9.8a-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove empty postinst/preinst/prerm scripts.  There is no need
    to have empty ones, debhelper will add them when needed.
  * Remove the static pic libraries.  Nobody should be linking
    it's shared libraries static to libssl or libcrypto.
    This was added for opensc who now links to it shared.
  * Do not assume that in case the sequence number is 0 and the
    packet has an odd number of bytes that the other side has
    the block padding bug, but try to check that it actually
    has the bug.  The wrong detection of this bug resulted
    in an "decryption failed or bad record mac" error in case
    both sides were using zlib compression.  (Closes: #338006)

    added symbol versioning, so it should have bumped the shlibs.
    (Closes: #338284)
  * The openssl package had a duplicate dependency on libssl0.9.8,
    only require the version as required by the shlibs.
  * Make libssl-dev depend on zlib1g-dev, since it's now required for
    static linking. (Closes: #338313)
  * Generate .pc files that make use of Libs.private, so things only
    link to the libraries they should when linking shared.
  * Use -m64 instead of -bpowerpc64-linux on ppc64. (Closes: #335486)
  * Make powerpc and ppc64 use the assembler version for bn.  ppc64
    had the location in the string wrong, powerpc had it missing.
  * Add includes for stddef to get size_t in md2.h, md4.h, md5.h,
    ripemd.h and sha.h.  (Closes: #333101)
  * Run make test for each of the versions we build, make it 
    not fail the build process if an error is found.
  * Add build dependency on bc for the regression tests.

  * Link to libz instead of dynamicly loading it.  It gets loaded
    at the moment the library is initialised, so there is no point

    it's not opened by it's soname, but by the symlink to it.
    This should hopefully solve most of the bugs people have reported
    since the move to libssl0.9.8.

    * Prompt for pass phrases when appropriate for PKCS12 input format.
    * Back-port of selected performance improvements from development

    * Add lots of checks for memory allocation failure, error codes to indicate
      failure and freeing up memory if a failure occurs.
    * Perform some character comparisons of different types in X509_NAME_cmp:
      this is needed for some certificates that reencode DNs into UTF8Strings

openssl (0.9.7c-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * upstream security fix (closes: #213451)
   - Fix various bugs revealed by running the NISCC test suite:
     Stop out of bounds reads in the ASN1 code when presented with
     invalid tags (CAN-2003-0543 and CAN-2003-0544).
     Free up ASN1_TYPE correctly if ANY type is invalid (CAN-2003-0545).
     If verify callback ignores invalid public key errors don't try to check
     certificate signature with the NULL public key.
   - In ssl3_accept() (ssl/s3_srvr.c) only accept a client certificate
     if the server requested one: as stated in TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0
     specifications.
  * more minor upstream bugfixes
  * fix formatting in c_issuer (closes: #190026)
  * fix Debian-FreeBSD support (closes: #200381)
  * restart some services in postinst to make them use the new libraries
  * remove duplicated openssl.1, crypto.3 and ssl.3 (closes: #198594)

openssl (0.9.7b-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * upstream security fix
   - Countermeasure against the Klima-Pokorny-Rosa extension of
     Bleichbacher's attack on PKCS #1 v1.5 padding: treat
     a protocol version number mismatch like a decryption error
     in ssl3_get_client_key_exchange (ssl/s3_srvr.c). (CAN-2003-0131)
    (closes: #189087)
   - Turn on RSA blinding by default in the default implementation
     to avoid a timing attack. Applications that don't want it can call
     RSA_blinding_off() or use the new flag RSA_FLAG_NO_BLINDING.
     They would be ill-advised to do so in most cases. (CAN-2003-0147)
   - Change RSA blinding code so that it works when the PRNG is not
     seeded (in this case, the secret RSA exponent is abused as
     an unpredictable seed -- if it is not unpredictable, there
     is no point in blinding anyway).  Make RSA blinding thread-safe
     by remembering the creator's thread ID in rsa->blinding and
     having all other threads use local one-time blinding factors
     (this requires more computation than sharing rsa->blinding, but
     avoids excessive locking; and if an RSA object is not shared
     between threads, blinding will still be very fast).

openssl (0.9.7a-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * upstream Security fix
    - In ssl3_get_record (ssl/s3_pkt.c), minimize information leaked
      via timing by performing a MAC computation even if incorrrect
      block cipher padding has been found.  This is a countermeasure
      against active attacks where the attacker has to distinguish
      between bad padding and a MAC verification error. (CAN-2003-0078)
    for more details see the CHANGES file
